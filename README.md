How EPS, Revenue Growth, and the Market Discount Rate affect the Price/Sales ratio of a Stock

In this project, I will use the 12 month forward eps estimate, 24 month forward eps estimate, 12 month trailing revenue growth, and industry indicator value for a company, along with the Bloomberg US High Yield rate, to build a model to predict the appropriate market cap/revenue multiple. 

My goal is to create three grids all starting in ~1995 and going to  the present. Grid 1 will display the average revenue multiple for each industry each year. Grid 2 will display the average projected revenue multiple of each industry using the model I build. Grid 3 will then show the difference between projected and actual revenue multiples for each year. I then hope to provide some commentary on why certain periods may have generated larger disparities than other periods.
